# comnet-install
script to set up comnet - community testing for the SAFE network


This is to be a script for a relative n00b to quickly and relatively painlessly get as far as PUT/GET cat and dog on the community nets
Of course, having declared all those vars at the top, if you chose not to accept the defaults it could be quite flexible. But anyone who needs that flexibility probably doesnt need this scriptâ€¦ Hmmm
