# comnet-install
script to set up comnet - community testing for the SAFE network


This is a script for a relative n00b to quickly get the safe cli and node binaries installed, connect to a test net and use vdash
to monitor their node. This is only for Ubuntu-like distros at the moment.

This is nowhere near ready for use at the moment. All advice and PRs welcome
